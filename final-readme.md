Why hello there! Welcome to our final project.

Setup:
1. npm install
2. npm start

Run `npm start` in the top level project dir to get it going, then load up localhost:5000/intro. Alternatively, go to http://my-little-saga.herokuapp.com/intro

Final build. Cool new features:

0. Awesome new viking sprite. This was drawn by Koleman's sister, so be nice. His name is Ragnar and he is friendly but timid. He also only has a walking animation, so don't expect him to swim or fight.
1. Save states. It saves map, position, enemies defeated, items picked up, and quest state. Try hitting save then reloading! No, really, try it. This was a bitch and a half to get going.
2. Different maps. Our underwater map doesn't have a quest associated but is a cool proof of concept for what can be done with different tilesets.
3. Improved map creator. As always, it can be found at /creator. Shift-click to delete tiles.
4. Campfire that regenerates health.
5. Teleport player to different map + arbitrary position. This was obnoxious as heck.
6. Fleshed out quest progression. Try finishing quests then fighting lots of enemies with your newfound abilities!

A+ plz
