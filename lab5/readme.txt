So I spent some time making jumping feel good.
I limit the height of each jump and only play the sound effect once. Double jumping is also a thing, so go hoos (jumps remaining reset on collision with a wall).
Collisions upwards with a platform and reaching a height 100 units higher than the jump start cause mario to peak (can't climb anymore on that jump).
There's no ground tho so have fun falling endlessly if you miss the platform. Don't worry though - you can press "r" if you fall to reset. 

I also did friction - when no keys are pressed mario will come to a stop.

Ok, I lied about resetting and now feel bad - pressing "r" won't do anything. You'll just have to refresh the page. Here. As a consolation prize, you can press "m" to toggle off the music. Do you forgive me now for lying??
