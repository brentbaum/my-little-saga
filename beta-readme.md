For the beta, we worked a lot more on the map creator, added quests, unique combat for different enemies.

We have a slight bug with the camera movement taht we haven't been able to figure out - Once the camera reaches the full left side on the second stage, it stops moving. On the right side, the camera doesn't stop at the edge. Other than that, it behaves fine. 

Try beating 5 bears and then fighting a bandit. This combination unlocks the "berserk" combat option. Differnet moves done in different order do cool things. For example, use magic three times to do 1000 damage. We plan on extending this system further in the final versino. If you have any rocks in your inventory, you can use it to attack a bear and deal 5000 (git rekd son)
